# Dokuwiki
I made a project based on file search in C language. 
Scan all files and only in txt extensions;
finding the files and lines of the searched word, updating the word to be changed and replaced by the user, recording how many repetitions of each word in tag format in a text file
In addition, there are libraries to ensure compatibility with Turkish characters.
